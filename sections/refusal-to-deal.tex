\section{Interconnect Obligations and Refusals to Deal}

rule: monopolists are not required to deal with anyone
    but there are exceptions:
        common carrier regulations
        aspen

aspen
-----
    1. monopoly power: yes
    2. exclusionary conduct: discontinuation of a practice

    right to refuse to deal: *not unqualified*
        qualification (i.e., why did aspen have a duty to deal): p. 603: 'the monopolist did not merely reject a novel offer...'
            not a de novo refusal to deal; rather, a change in a course of dealing
            *termination of a profitable course of dealing*
            --> *de novo refusal vs. termination of existing relationship*

    essential facilities doctrine:
        applies to de novo refusals to deal.
        1. essential facility
        2. someone who wants access
        3. facility cannot easily be duplicated
        doctrine: all but dead in the u.s.; but in europe, a duty of fair dealing

    termination is anticompetitive if the monopolist makes a sacrifice
        *sacrifice*: ski co. sacrifices profits; p. 608Â 

trinko
------
    savings clause in the 1996 act: does not preempt antitrust laws; i.e., antitrust laws still apply here
    'monopoly is good' argument: *p. 879: 'the mere possession of monopoly power and the charging of monopoly prices...'*
        i.e.: everybody in business wants to charge higher-than-normal prices
    exclusionary conduct: not a refusal to deal; rather, provisioning of deliberately crummy services to at\&t

    exceptions to the 'no duty to deal' rule:
        1. aspen
            prior course of dealing? yes--but it was *not voluntary*--it was imposed by statute
        2. essential facilities
            no--there *was* access here. (even if access was minimal.)
        3. should there be other exceptions?
            no.
            the 1996 act sufficiently protects consumers and competitors bc it provides a way for at\&t to gain access to vzn's infrastructure. we dont need an antitrust claim

    no role for antitrust in a deregulated industry.

------

no profit sacrifice (in total--even though msft may have lost some profits in the OS market)
    privileges vertically integrated companies
    this rule could justify behavior that is unlawful under other rules -- e.g., how would kodak have argued under this rule?

may holders of standards essential patents seek injunctions?
how to calculate royalties?
