\section{Interconnect Obligations and Refusals to Deal}

Monopolists generally are not required to deal with anyone, but there are 
exceptions---e.g., common carrier regulations, \emph{Aspen} (discontinuation of 
a practice).

\subsection{Discontinuation of a Practice: \emph{Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen 
Highlands Skiing Corp.}}

Discontinuation of a practice can count as exclusionary conduct.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There were four ski mountains in Aspen. Ski Co. operated three of 
    them. Highlands operated the fourth.
    \item For awhile, they agreed to provide an all-Aspen, six-day pass that 
    was valid at all of the resorts. Eventually, Ski Co. refused to continue to 
    offer the ticket with Highlands. Highlands essentially became a day resort.
    \item Highlands alleged that Ski Co.'s refusal to deal was a violation of 
    \S\ 2.
    \item Ski Co. admitted it had monopoly power.\footnote{413.}
    \item Held: Ski Co. \emph{did} have a duty to deal.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This was not a de novo refusal to deal. Rather, it was a 
        \textbf{termination of a profitable course of dealing}.\footnote{603.}
        \item Termination is anticompetitive if the monopolist makes a 
        sacrifice. Here, Ski Co. sacrificed profits.\footnote{608.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

------
    savings clause in the 1996 act: does not preempt antitrust laws; i.e., antitrust laws still apply here
    'monopoly is good' argument: *p. 879: 'the mere possession of monopoly power and the charging of monopoly prices...'*
        i.e.: everybody in business wants to charge higher-than-normal prices
    exclusionary conduct: not a refusal to deal; rather, provisioning of deliberately crummy services to at\&t

    exceptions to the 'no duty to deal' rule:
        1. aspen
            prior course of dealing? yes--but it was *not voluntary*--it was imposed by statute
        2. essential facilities
            no--there *was* access here. (even if access was minimal.)
        3. should there be other exceptions?
            no.
            the 1996 act sufficiently protects consumers and competitors bc it provides a way for at\&t to gain access to vzn's infrastructure. we dont need an antitrust claim

    no role for antitrust in a deregulated industry.

no profit sacrifice (in total--even though msft may have lost some profits in the OS market)
    privileges vertically integrated companies
    this rule could justify behavior that is unlawful under other rules -- e.g., how would kodak have argued under this rule?
