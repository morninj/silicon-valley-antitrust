\subsubsection{Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Broadcom alleged that Qualcomm, by acting deceptively towards private 
    standards organizations and predatorily acquiring a rival, violated \S\S\ 
    1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and \S\ 7 of the Clayton Act.\footnote{303.}
    \item The district court granted Qualcomm's 12(b)(6) motion.
    \item Held: Broadcom stated claims for monopolization and attempted 
    monopolization under \S\ 2, but that it lacked standing because it does 
    not compete or intend to compete in the market.
    \item The technology at issue was Qualcomm's WCDMA, part of the 3G system 
    known as the UMTS standard.\footnote{303-04.}
    \item Claim 1: Monopolization.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The district court erred in dismissing. Abuse of a private 
        standard-setting process \emph{does} state a claim under antitrust 
        law.\footnote{306--17.}
        ~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Claim 2: Attempted monopolization.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The district court erred in dismissing.\footnote{317--18.}
        ~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Claim 7: Monopoly maintenance.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dismissal was proper.\footnote{319--21.}
