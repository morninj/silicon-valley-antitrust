\section{Very Short Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Monopolies only become problematic when they harm consumers. Scalia: 
    monopolies are good.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sherman Act \S\ 1: Agreements in Restraint of Trade}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two prongs: (1) agreement (2) in restraint of trade.
    \item Doesn't just apply to horizontal agreements. Can also apply to 
    tying or exclusive dealing (which are vertical agreements).
    \item \textbf{Per se}: price fixing, market allocation, boycotting. 
    Independent of market power. \emph{Andreas}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can lead to false positives. If the restrictive agreement is 
        \textbf{ancillary} to an underlying procompetitive transaction, there 
        is no \S\ 1 violation. \emph{BMI v. Columbia}.
        \item Courts will only apply the per se rule where there has been 
        \textbf{significant judicial experience.}
        \item Upstream agreements can be per se unlawful. \emph{U.S. v. 
        Adobe}, \emph{U.S. v. Apple}. % TODO other takeaways from apple?
        \item (Tying can also be a \S\ 1 offense. And it can be a per se 
        offense---but usually not. See \S\ 2 below.)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule of reason}: unlawful if anticompetitive effects (AE) 
    are greater than the procompetitive efficiencies (PE).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analyzing a Horizontal Agreement Problem}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Was this a literal \textbf{per se offense} (price fixing, market 
    allocation, boycott)?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Yes:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Has there been significant judicial experience?
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Yes: \emph{violation of \S\ 1}.
                \item No: apply rule of reason.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item No: go to rule of reason analysis.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Was the agreement \textbf{ancillary} to an underlying procompetitive 
    transaction (as in BMI)?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Yes: apply rule of reason.
        \item No: \emph{violation of \S\ 1}.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule of reason}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Market power: is the defendant's market share greater than 30\%?
        \item Is there a plausible theory of harm?
        \item Is there proof of harm?
        \item Court asks: AE > PE?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sherman Act \S\ 2: Abuse of Monopoly Position}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requires (1) \textbf{monopoly power} and (2) \textbf{exclusionary 
    conduct}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analyzing a \S\ 2 Monopolization Problem}

Requires monopoly power, exclusionary conduct, and causation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monopoly power}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Direct proof, and/or
        \item Indirect proof:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Market definition---the \textbf{SSNIP test}:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Purpose}: identify the smallest relevant market 
                in which a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose an 
                increase in price.
                \item \textbf{Test}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Start with the smallest possible market.
                    \item If a hypothetical monopolist controlled all the 
                    products in the market, could it profitably impose a 5\% 
                    price increase?
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item No (i.e., consumers would substitute other 
                        products): go back to step 1 and expand the market.  
                        \item Yes: this is the relevant market.
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Example}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Market \#1: scotch.
                    \item If a hypothetical monopolist raised the price by 5\%, 
                    would consumers switch to something else? Yes—so the 
                    market is too narrow.
                    \item Market \#2: scotch and bourbon.
                    \item If a hypothetical monopolist raised the price by 5\%, 
                    would consumers switch to something else? No—so this is 
                    the relevant market. 
                \end{itemize}
            \end{enumerate}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The market definition can include \textbf{nascent 
                threats}. \emph{Microsoft}.
            \end{enumerate}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Avoid the \emph{Cellophane} fallacy: if a monopolist has 
                had a monopoly for a long time, then it will already be 
                charging a monopoly price, so this test fails. There's no good 
                way to deal with this.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Significant market share (somewhere around 60\% or more).
            \item Barriers to entry.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Network effects can be a barrier to entry. 
                \emph{Microsoft.}
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exclusionary conduct}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        % TODO: verify. See HK slides 04-02, slide 10, at http://www.hannokaiser.com/lawschool/2013-fall-svat/slides/2013-svatf-04-02.pdf)
        \item Exclusion of \textbf{interoperability layers}. \emph{Microsoft}.
        \item Exclusion of \textbf{nascent threats}. Nascent threats may 
        be entitled to stronger protections than small but established 
        competitors. \emph{Microsoft}.
        \item \textbf{Predatory innovation}.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Microsoft} test: plaintiff must make a prima facie 
            case of predation; defendant can rebut; plaintiff must show 
            that the exclusionary effects outweigh the defendant's 
            justifications.
            \item \emph{Allied Ortho} test: any benefit to the consumer 
            establishes \textbf{per se legality}, regardless of predation 
            or effects on the market. Ninth Circuit only.
            \item \emph{FTC v. Intel}: consent decree rejected the 
            \emph{Allied Ortho} test.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Tying}. \emph{Kodak} 
        (p.~\pageref{kodak-tying-claim}), \emph{Datel}. Four elements:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Two products} (e.g., Kodak copier parts and 
            services).
            \item \textbf{Tie} (e.g., Kodak's policy change to require 
            buyers of Kodak parts to use Kodak services). Can be 
            contractual (\emph{Kodak}), economic, technological.
            \item Market power in the \emph{tying} product (the ``must 
            have'' product---e.g., Kodak parts). \textbf{Be sure to define 
            the right market.}
            \item Some effect in the \emph{tied} product market (e.g., 
            all services for Kodak copiers). Define the market here, too.
            \item 
        \end{enumerate}
        % TODO open and closed systems? here or elsewhere?
        \item \textbf{Refusal to deal}: monpolists generally are not required 
        to deal with anyone, but there are exceptions---e.g., common carrier 
        regulations, \textbf{discontinuation of a practice} (for companies 
        with significant market power---over 60\%---\emph{Aspen}), and the 
        essential facilities doctrine (which is rarely used). You generally 
        have to show \textbf{profit sacrifice} to show exclusionary conduct. 
        \emph{Trinko}.
        % TODO abuse of standards essential patents?
        % TODO google?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Business justifications}. Key question: \textbf{does AE > 
    PE}? (But see \emph{Allied Ortho} just above, under predatory innovation.)
    \item \textbf{Causation}: the exclusionary conduct creates or reinforces 
    the monopoly power.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Clayton Act \S\ 7: Mergers and Acquisitions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No acquisition of shares or assets that would likely result in a 
    ``substantial lessening of competition.''
\end{enumerate}
